#Topic: Variables

#Python has no command for declaring a variable

n = "---- Variables being declared ----"

p = 5

y = "Olivia"
print(n)

print(p)

print(y)

#Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

#EXAMPLE
k = "---- Variables being declared ----"
x = 4 # x is of the type int (integer)
x = "Olivia" # x is now of type str (string)
print(k)
print(x)
