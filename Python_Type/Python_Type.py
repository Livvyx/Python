#Topic: Get The Type

z = "---- Getting the Datatype of a Variable with the type() function ----"
a = 10 #Declaring a integer

b = "Olivia" #Declaring a string

print(z)
print(type(a)) #Getting the datatype of a variable with the type() Function
print(type(b)) #Getting the datatype of a variable with the type() Function

#Single or Double Quotes

#string variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

#EXAMPLE
x = "---- String variables being declared ----"
c = "Olive Oil"

#The same as 

d = 'Olives'

print(x)
print(c)
print(d)

#Case Sensitive

#variables are case sensitive

#EXAMPLE - This will create two variables

D = "---- Creating two variables with case sensitivity ----"
e = 1
E = "Olivia"

print(D)
print(e)
print(E)
